/* Trie, also called prefix tree, is a special form of Nary tree. In this card, we will go deep into the implementation of Trie and talk about how 
to use this data structure to solve problems. Typically, a trie is used to store strings. Each Trie node represents a string (a prefix). Each node might have
several children nodes while the paths to different children nodes represent different characters. And the strings on the child nodes represent will be the origin
string represented by the node itself plus the character on the path. 

Root node is assocuated with an empty string. All descendants of a node have a common prefix associated with that node. 

You can use an array for a tree with the array that stores its childr
